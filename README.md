## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Your challenge is to build out this testimonials page using CSS grid and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The html includes the text on the page but you will need to add html elements and an external CSS file.

- First create a Figma file for the project before (this will help when coding the CSS)

- Use Media Queries to show the optimal layout for the site depending on the device's screen size.

- Use custom CSS variables for colors
